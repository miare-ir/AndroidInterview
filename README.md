## Android Interview
######  We have an interview, yay

### TL;DR
Clone this project, open it in Android Studio, install **GitLive**, sign-in to it.

#### What is this?
This project is sort of a playground for you. It has a bunch of useful stuff which will be used in the interview process, feel free to explore it (it's not cheating).

#### What do I do with this?
- Clone it
- Open it in Android Studio
- Let it download its dependencies
- Make the project once (since we have some intermediate classes which need to be generated)

#### Then what?
You need to install [GitLive](https://git.live/) on your Android Studio. We'll use it to collaborate on the code, basically it let's me see what you write in your IDE without sharing the entire screen (as a big laggy crappy image).
Here are the steps you need to follow:
- Open this project in your Android Studio
- Go to File > Settings > Plugins
- Click on the gear icon on the top right corner
- Click on Manage Plugin Repositories...
- Click on plus sign and add this url as a repository `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/androidstudio`
- Click OK
- Go to Marketplace tab on the plugin page
- Type **GitLive** in search bar
- Click Install and let it download and install it
- You probably will have to restart your IDE afterwards

#### I wasn't able to install GitLive, what do I do?
[This](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=How+to+install+GitLive+on+Android+Studio) might help.

#### I installed GitLive on my Android Studio like a boss
Awesome.
- Now click on GitLive on the bottom bar (in the IDE) and sign-in using your Github account.
- Then **send me** your github username so I can add you to the project.
- After I've done so, you should be able to see me ([Ali Lotfi](https://github.com/alilotfi/)) down there.
  - If it is the case, you're good to go. You don't need to do anything else till our appointment. 
  - If it is not the case, let me know. We'll figure it out.
