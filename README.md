## Android Interview
######  We have an interview, yay

### TL;DR

Clone this project, open it in Android Studio and build it.

#### What is this?

This project is sort of a playground for you. It has a bunch of useful stuff which will be used in
the interview process, feel free to explore it (it's not cheating).

#### What do I do with this?

  - Clone it
  - Open it in Android Studio
  - Let it download its dependencies
  - Make the project once (since we have some intermediate classes which need to be generated)
  - Explore the questions we will work on by searching `Q(\d)+:` as a regex.
  - Chill :)

#### What's the interview like?

We've tried to make the interview similar to our day-to-day work environment as much as it's
possible. It means that:

  - You would have access to Internet, stackoverflow, official documentations, your other code
    bases, ...
  - There's no penalty for searching the internet or copy pasting code from other sources. There's
    only a penalty for not succeeding to solve the problem.
  - We have not memorized all of the Android's APIs, we do not value memorizing them, and we don't
    expect you to have them memorized. We're developers too.
  - Since the interview might take an hour or two, please feel free to have a break during it and
    pour yourself a cup of coffee, play a music in the background or anything else that you would
    do during actual work days. It's just a normal coding session, not a big deal.
  - During the interview we will ask you to share your screen with us. If this makes you nervous or
    you don't feel comfortable doing this, you can stop sharing your screen, work on the problem as
    you might, and just share your screen when you feel confident about your solution to the
    question at hand. We will discuss your solution and then move on to the next question.
